# Text-to-image synthesis using CVQVAE
## Pytorch implementation of conditional-VQVAE2 for generating high-fidelity multi-object images based on text captions.

original paper: [Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00446)

This implementation is optimized for the MS-COCO dataset (Captions 2014).

The code was imported from ipynb notebook and is in post processing.
